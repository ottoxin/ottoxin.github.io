## Themes

### Platformed political communication
I examine how recommendation systems, interaction affordances, and moderation policies influence the spread of contentious information.

### Generative AI in discourse formation
I investigate how large language models can both mitigate and amplify polarization depending on prompt framing, interface context, and user goals.

### Computational methods for communication science
My work combines network analysis, NLP, multimodal modeling, and reproducible pipelines for large-scale media datasets.

# Computational media research on platforms, narratives, and AI.

I am **Haohang (Otto) Xin**, a Ph.D. student in Media, Technology, and Society at Northwestern University.
I study how platform design, algorithmic ranking, and generative AI shape political discourse and public understanding.

## Current focus

- **Digital propaganda ecosystems** across platforms and media formats.
- **Polarization and echo chambers** in high-conflict online conversations.
- **Multimodal methods** for studying text, image, and video narratives at scale.
- **Responsible AI workflows** for transparent computational communication research.

## Background

I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Journalism (Honors) and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
At UW–Madison, I worked with the Social Media and Democracy (SMAD) and Cognitive Effects Research Group (KEG) teams on computational and machine learning projects.

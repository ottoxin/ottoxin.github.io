你好(Hello)! My name is Haohang Xin, feel free to call me Otto. I'm currently a senior pursuing dual degrees in **Journalism (Honors)** and **Data Science** at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Starting Fall 2025, I’ll begin my Ph.D. in **Media, Technology, and Society** in School of Communication at Northwestern University, advised by Professor [Yingdan Lu](https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/yingdan-lu.html).

My research lives at the exciting (and slightly chaotic) intersection of digital technology, media, and society. I'm particularly intrigued by how digital platforms and algorithms influence public discourse, shape perceptions, and amplify certain voices, especially around controversial or polarizing issues. Recently, my work has explored how misinformation spreads, the mechanics behind online echo chambers, and the unique roles large language models (LLMs) play in moderating or magnifying these phenomena.

As an undergraduate research assistant at UW’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication, I have contributed to the [Social Media and Democracy (SMAD)](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/smad/) group led by Professor [Dhavan Shah](https://journalism.wisc.edu/news/staff/dhavan-v-shah/) and the [Cognitive Effects Research Group (KEG)](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/keg/) led by Professor [Douglas McLeod](https://journalism.wisc.edu/news/staff/douglas-m-mcleod/) since 2023. My work involves everything from intricate data engineering to building machine learning models, aiming to untangle complex social dynamics through computational methods.

My recent projects explore the use of advanced computational methods, including multimodal analysis and generative AI, to study communication dynamics in digital spaces. I'm particularly passionate about developing innovative tools and methods that make computational research more interpretable, transparent, and accessible because science is always better open-source!

In my downtime (when I'm not debugging code or chasing elusive data points), you might find me listening to music with my cat Callie or writing foodie comments.
